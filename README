Welcome to Antlers!
Antlers seeks to be a simple antenna calculating machine, capable of handling
any antenna you know the equation for, and making the math simple.  Never
worry about dulled pencils, or dead calculator batteries again!  Let antlers do 
the work, and print out the results, it may amaze you!

I have designed Antlers to 
*create a custom solution focused on the needs of their particular radio
 situation
*Implement a cross platform system so as many hams as possible can use it
 as easily as possible.
*Help you build antennas!  The folumas that come default are formulas 
 designed to help you build antennas.  If you want other formulas, you
 are free to add them on your own, under your own menu settings.

Consider it liscensed under the MIT liscense, just like Ruby!
